# Automatidata-Consulting-Project-Inspecting-Preparing-NYC-Taxi-Data-for-Analysis-Using-Python

## A PROJECT STILL BEING WORKED ON

📌 Project Overview

This project simulates work completed at a fictional data consulting firm, Automatidata, for a real-world client scenario: the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC).

The objective of this phase is not advanced modeling, but to understand the dataset, assess data quality, and prepare it for future analysis.

🎯 Project Goals

Ensure the dataset is ready for:

Insight generation

Visualizations

Future hypothesis testing

Identify key variables and potential data issues

Communicate findings clearly to team members

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Structure

Part 1: Understanding the Situation

Reviewed the client background and project objectives

Identified why NYC TLC data is being analyzed

Clarified the role of the analyst in early-stage data exploration

Why this matters:

Business context prevents misinterpretation and misaligned analysis.

Part 2: Understanding the Data

Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame

Reviewed:

Dataset dimensions

Column names

Data types

Missing values

Summary statistics

Why this matters:

Initial inspection reveals data quality issues and informs next analytical steps.

Part 3: Understanding the Variables

Examined key variables related to:

Trip distance

Fare amounts

Payment methods

Trip duration

Identified unusual values and potential outliers

Why this matters:

Variable-level understanding is required before visualization or modeling.

📊 Key Findings

Some variables may require cleaning or transformation

Certain numerical fields show wide ranges, suggesting possible outliers

Data is suitable for deeper exploratory analysis after preprocessing

🚀 Next Steps

Clean and transform variables

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Build visualizations

Conduct statistical analysis or modeling
